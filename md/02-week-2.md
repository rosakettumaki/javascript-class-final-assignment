## Optional exercises
1. Add a tooltip to the multiple line chart from `01-line-charts/03-multiple-lines.js` that shows the country name when you hover over a line.

2. Animate the lines from exercise 1 so they're drawn one after the other.

4. Take a look at the code from any examples in the fullstack D3 textbook that interest you.
